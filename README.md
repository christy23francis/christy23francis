## Hi there! 👋

I'm a frontend developer with **4 years of experience** working with Angular. I have a **strong knowledge** of HTML and CSS, and I'm currently working at EY.

### Previous experience 🔍

Before joining EY, I used to work at TCS where I gained valuable experience in various web development projects.

### Backend knowledge 💻

I also have knowledge in [Supabase](https://supabase.io/), a backend-as-a-service that allows developers to quickly set up a PostgreSQL database and API. I know how to **set up a database for a project** and create database functions to **retrieve data from the backend to the frontend**.

### Let's connect! 🤝
